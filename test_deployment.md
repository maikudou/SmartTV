# Different ways of vendors' test deployment

## Samsung

### 2014
1. Just put your code along with non-tizen `config.xml` and `widget.info` files in a folder on an USB-stick
2. Plug the stick in a tv and find your app in "My Apps" section of the SmartHub. You may need to click
small "recycle" arrows to see the second page of your apps. The newly installed app will have small "usb-stick" icon on it.
The app will remain installed as long as you have the usb-stick in it.

## Samsung Tizen
1. Build a wgt-file with the SDK
2. Put it on an USB-stick in `userwidget` foder
